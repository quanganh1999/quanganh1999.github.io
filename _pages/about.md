I am currently a research engineer at [Samsung SDS](https://www.samsungsds.com/vn/index.html) R&D Center Vietnam and a Master's student at Phenikaa University. Previously, I was a research assistant at [ORLab](http://orlab.com.vn/) under the supervision of Professor [Minh Hoàng Hà](https://sites.google.com/view/minhhoangha/). I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from VNU University of Engineering and Technology. My research interests are Operations Research (Routing and Scheduling problems), Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Search) and Combinatorial Optimization techniques (Metaheuristic and Integer & Dynamic Programming). 
<!-- My current work focuses on studying Job Scheduling (Dispatching) Problems with HPC Applications in Cloud Computing Environments.  -->
