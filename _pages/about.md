I am currently a research engineer at [SMU School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/), supervised by Professor [Akshat Kumar](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/akshatkumar/), and a Master's student at [Phenikaa University](https://phenikaa-uni.edu.vn/en). Previously, I worked as a research engineer at [Samsung SDS](https://www.samsungsds.com/vn/index.html) R&D Center Vietnam. During my undergraduate studies and one year thereafter, I served as a research assistant under the supervision of Professor [Minh Hoàng Hà](https://sites.google.com/view/minhhoangha/) at [ORLab](http://orlab.com.vn/). I earned my BSc degree in Computer Science from [VNU University of Engineering and Technology](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/en/). My research interests are Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Search), Operations Research (Routing and Scheduling problems),  and Combinatorial Optimization techniques (Metaheuristic and Integer & Dynamic Programming).
<!-- My current work focuses on studying Job Scheduling (Dispatching) Problems with HPC Applications in Cloud Computing Environments.  -->
