I am a research assistant at [ORLab](http://orlab.com.vn/) in Phenikaa University. My supervisor is Professor [Minh Hoàng Hà](https://sites.google.com/view/minhhoangha/). I hold a BSc in Computer Science from VNU University of Engineering and Technology. My research interests are operations research, artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization techniques such as metaheuristic and integer & dynamic programming. My current work focuses on dealing with Vehicle Routing Problems.
